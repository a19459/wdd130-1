    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Ed Swanson</h2>
    <p>Greetings everone.  I have had many nicknames but most I cannot post here.  I am currently working towards my degree in Computer Science, but my end goal is earn a PhD in Digital Forensics.</p>
    <p>I am married to a eternal companion, Tammy, and we just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary.  We have two awesome sons and we are hoping for grand kids.  </p>
    <p>I have been in the IT field for over 42 years and installed the first CD-Rom drive for the CompUAdd - Culebra store I worked at in San Antonio.  I currently work for a law enforcement agency in Sacramento, CA as a Digital Forensic Analyst.  I am lucky to have a strong faith base, because what I have seen in the course of my job is heartbreaking to say the least.</p>
    <p>I became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Sainta when I was 33.  Before that, I was Protestant, but have lived in many places as a dependant of a military family, so I have been to many different churches.  I have been to Methodist, Protestant, Baptist, Southern Baptist, Seven Day Adventist, multiple non-denominational churches, Shinto shrines, Buddhist temple, and even a Jewish synagogue.  I have friends from many different faiths and non-faith, but I am grateful for my wife and her introducing me the Bo0ok of Mormon.</p>  
    <p> E-Safety tip:  Anything you send electronically is out there forever.  Be careful what you post, text, Snapchat (I have recovered many "deleted" images), e-mail, or
        any other electronic communication platform.  I practiced on my phone and pulled images and text messages that I thought were gone forever.
